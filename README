Mannual for Running Simulation Code:-

1. Description of files

  i) Each entity of the network has been treated as a node which has some co-ordinates as x-axis and y-axis. 
     Total three files are there for this named Node.ned, Node.h and Node.cc. Node.cc file is the source file.
     
 ii) Base Station: There are three files for this- BaseStation.ned, BS.h and BS.cc. Class BS is extending class Node.
     All the source codes are in BS.cc.
 
 iii) Sensor: Sensor.ned file contains the source for type of node to be displayed as sensor while running simulation.
      Sensor.cc and sensor.h files are containing the source codes for sensor functionalities.

 iv) There is a network file named WSN.ned which contains the discription of entities present in the network. Also,
     an omnetpp.ini file is there which is required for starting the omnet++ simulation.


2. Steps for running the Simulation:-

  i) Install the latest version of OMNET++.

  ii) Go to the folder omnetpp where it has installed. Go to the folder omnetpp->Samples

  iii) Create a new project folder here and copy all the files in this newly created folder.

  iv) Start the omnetpp using terminal or double clicking the icon. See left side file structure and find your folder.
  
   v) Right click on the project folder and click on "Build Project". It will compile the project source code.
      It will through some compilation error if it exists. If there is no error then fine.

  vi) Again right click on the project folder and click on "Run as -> Omnet++ Sumilation". Network structure will open.
      Now click on "run" icon at upper left. Now see the simulation result.
